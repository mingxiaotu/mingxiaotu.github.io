My name is Mingxiao (David) Tu, and I am a first-year PhD student at the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney, supported by the Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP). I graduated with honors in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science in 2023, achieving an average WAM of 86, and was recognized as a Dalyell Scholar (top 2% academic results). I received the Sydney Scholars Award, two Summer Vacation Research Scholarships from the University of Sydney, and two Summer Vacation Scholarships from CSIRO. I am also teaching multiple units, including COMP3888, COMP2123, ENGG1810, and ENGD2001.

My research focuses on augmented reality-assisted surgery, a cutting-edge field that integrates advanced visualization technologies into surgical procedures. By overlaying digital information onto the surgeon's view, augmented reality can enhance precision, improve decision-making, and reduce the risk of complications. My goal is to develop innovative AR solutions that transform how complex surgeries are performed, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
 
Driven by a passion for healthcare, I aim to improve the lives of individuals affected by diseases and disabilities. Enthusiastic and driven, I am always ready to embrace new challenges.
